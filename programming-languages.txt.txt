For me the most popular programming languages are Java , JavaScript , C++ and C#.

About Issues C# vs C++
Limitation: With C#, features like multiple inheritance from classes (C# implements a different approach called Multiple Implementation, 
where a class can implement more than one interface), declaring objects on the stack, deterministic destruction (allowing RAII) 
and allowing default arguments as function parameters (in C# versions < 4.0) will not be available.
Performance (speed and size): Applications built in C# may not perform as well when compared with native C++. C# has an intrusive garbage collector,
reference tracking and other overheads with some of the framework services. The .NET framework alone has a big runtime footprint (~30 Mb of memory), 
and requires that several versions of the framework be installed.
Flexibility: Due to the dependency on the .NET framework, operating system level functionality (system level APIs) 
is buffered by a generic set of functions that will reduce some freedoms.

In my opinian Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly,
and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind,
both use garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++.



Javascript is a non-typed scripting language, which means it typically runs uncompiled in browsers. 

C# is a strongly-typed language, which is typically compiled into a .dll.
